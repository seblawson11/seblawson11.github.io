Sustainability is an unfortunately diluted word. It is slapped on every corporate mission statement and headlines every advert for a new cleaning product. Yes, we live in a world where we don’t just have washing detergents, but sustainable washing detergents. The consequences of this rather banal corporate lingo is that we don’t really know what sustainable actually means anymore. However, there is hope for clarity in the case of sustainable buildings. Timber is the answer, trees are the tool.

When we think of felling trees we think of deforestation. The semantics of chopping down a tree is evocative, bringing to mind the declining rainforests of the world. Yet one can be wholeheartedly against the necessity of this, whilst promoting the necessity of sustainable timber production. Like most environmental considerations, it is far more complicated than this surface level analysis.

If looking to maximise carbon sequestration then forestry is crucial; after varying decades, depending on the species, trees tend to reach an optimal amount sequestered per year, beyond which economists might call diminishing returns. If your goal is to maximise carbon sequestration it therefore makes sense to cut these trees down, perhaps staggered, and then replant. This leaves you with the question of what you then do with this wood. If you use it as fuel then you will re-release the carbon into the atmosphere, meaning at best that use can only be carbon neutral. A more effective method would be to keep the carbon locked into the wood.

Converting wood into timber ensures the carbon does not get re- released unless the wood decomposes or combusts. From an environmental perspective this can be beneficial for two reasons: the counterfactual of using more intensive concrete or steel is forgone, and in place of the trees chopped down another crop can be planted. As a result the cycle can start all over again. If this land is properly managed then the stock can replenish itself without a so-called deforestation event. The land simply loses its trees as the trees lose their leaves.

The timespan for this cycle is of course a case of decades rather than months, yet this is a marked improvement on the timescale for the geological replenishment of mineral deposits. It is at least within our lifetimes. In comparison to the extraction of iron ore used for steel, timber can be classified as part of a truly sustainable process relative to the human demand and timescale. With the advent of aggressive net zero targets, timber buildings cannot provide a silver bullet, but they are an example of how our economy can alter itself in partnership with the natural world. As opposed to treating the built environment as something very separate from nature, timber buildings can remind us city-dwellers we are a part of nature, rather than separate to it.

Timber in construction, if managed prudently, can allow us to look beyond carbon at an economy that values nature for more than extraction. Whisper it quietly, it may also be sustainable.
