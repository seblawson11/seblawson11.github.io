The current traffic light system on food packaging is essentially a nationwide marketing strategy for a set of predefined nutritional benchmarks. It reeks of the UK nudge movement that looks to shift consumer behaviour without explicit enforcement or restrictions. Instead, nudge tactics predictably shift behaviour without compromising consumer choice. The theory is that people can still choose between the red and green options, even if their subconscious tendency is towards the green. They have an illusion of choice.

There has been a growing call for similar labelling for the environmental impact of the food we buy, alongside other goods. I don’t need to spell out the supposed benefits of such a scheme. The Carbon Trust have been looking to develop a recognised verification system that incorporates various brackets of CO2 use, such as a ‘reducing CO2’ label or a ‘carbon neutral’ measure. Here we run into the first problem — these metrics are incredibly complex and struggle to be channelled into a PhD thesis, let alone a solitary label.

What for example does reducing CO2 mean? If you go onto the Carbon Trust’s website it makes this a bit clearer, but if you’re a fatigued consumer hurrying through a food shop to get home after work, then you don’t really want to take the time to work out what it all means.

You also have the problem of the sheer quantity of environmental and social factors that go into each product. If you try to incorporate everything, then packaging will require an attached compendium to cover every variable; key metrics have to be chosen. For example, carbon footprint seems to be the main area of current focus; is this a metric decisive enough to sway consumer behaviour? Should the carbon footprint of a good transfer your purchasing decision away from the ethically sourced to the unethically sourced?


We also need to remember that the existence of labels are reflexive with producers, meaning their existence also impacts what producers focus on. A Diet Coke has all green boxes on the nutritional traffic light system, whereas a pack of almonds has a red box for the fat content, even though such things as healthy fats exist. Labelling will always be simple enough for the producer to game. Whatever is the focus of the labelling will become the focus of the producer, perhaps to the detriment of more uniquely important issues. For example, in parts of the world where water scarcity is an issue, this may be weighted of higher importance than the carbon footprint, but the producer may choose to focus on reducing the carbon footprint instead as they know this acts as a better market signal of superiority.

So in response to this, should we have a series of labels each representing different environmental variables relating to such things as greenhouse gas emissions, water-use and welfare in production? To mirror the array of nutritional groups there could also be an array of environmental variables; perhaps traffic-lighted as well. But again, a standardised metric doesn’t take into account the relative importance of each variable across geographies. A bit like the idea that not all calories are created equal.

We also have to consider the complications accounting each metric. For nutritional brackets this is easier, as you are dealing with a static product that can be analysed in a lab. But with carbon footprint tracking, there are so many variables in the whole supply chain that a supposedly accurate measurement can at best be indicative rather than quantifiable. Working out the environmental impact of a good is just a lot more complicated than working out the nutrition breakdown of food.

The metrics that the Carbon Trust seek to measure are relatively uncontroversial, it is the methods of calculation that are. Most will agree a high carbon footprint is bad, but it is the way this is calculated that is controversial. The nutritional measurements have the opposite effect, running us into problems such as: should we be saying high calories are bad and low calories are good just because we can measure how many there are?

The danger in trying to refine the environmental impact of a good is that it causes an informational overload for the consumer. We end up with a derivative of the paradox of choice, where we are so overburdened by combinations of labels that we struggle to choose anything at all. The modern person is after all, rather time poor.

In spite of the many flaws, the question that remains is whether it is better than no information for the consumer. Will we get a result where the presence of both nutritional and environmental labelling in fact diminishes the efficacy of each of them? Does a carbon neutral label deter people from looking at the nutritional label and vice versa?

It’s worth mentioning that we do already have the organic and origin country labelling on some foods. Perhaps though, the success of these two features is precisely because people tend not to think of them as environmental indicators; they also think of them for their second-order effects of healthier food or supporting the domestic economy.

Clearly there is a need for greater consumer awareness of the impact of what they are buying and eating, but can the complexity of this be fairly articulated in a series of traffic-light labels? Global supply chains are incredibly complex, so good luck to anyone charged with accurately quantifying the true impact of our food. Perhaps the best we can hope for is that the whole exercise makes the consumer think of the impact of what they eat, rather than take any labelling as gospel truth.
