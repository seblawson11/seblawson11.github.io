<h3>Abstract</h3>
This study assesses the internets impact on Robert Dahl’s five criteria for political equality, which provides a tool to analyse the internet holistically through democracy as a process. To each of the criteria I take a philosophical approach and when necessary look to the past to aid my conviction that many of the issues with the internet and each of the criteria are not new issues in the debate about democracy. This forms an overall image of democracy as imperfect in itself, whilst the internet is a fundamentally beneficial platform for political equality. I define the internet as being shaped by the social dynamics of its users meaning its problems are more a reflection of its users, rather than the internet being fundamentally perverse to democracy. Through this lens the internet has been encouraging in the strive for political equality, whilst I accept the limitations of this framework as the complexities of the internet may require extending the criteria by number or definition.
Given I reach a positive conclusion the critique of democracy must in large be directed towards individual states who can distort the democratic process, and responsibility must be taken by citizens who use and shape the internet as a malleable platform. The internet has taken us closer to each of Dahl’s criteria, but the problems surrounding each requirement are often blamed upon the internet. I instead maintain that they are more a reflection of its users. The internet is made vulnerable by its own construction and definition, but is ultimately a benefit to the process of democracy. The problems are more damning of democracy and its relationship with citizens rather than the internet and its relationship to politics.
