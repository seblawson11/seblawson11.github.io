  <li>212-213</li>

</ul>
<br>

<h3>Volume Two: <i>In the Shadow of Young Girls in Flower</i></h3>
<ul>
<li>(Pg) 14/ when our wish to be touched by nature or art is prompted by the hope of a grandiose revelation, we are loth to let it be replaced by lesser impressions, which might mislead us as to the true value of beauty.</li>
<li>34/ in politics, it was a mark of superiority rather than inferiority to repeat what everyone else thought</li>
<li>57/ theoretically we are aware that the earth is spinning, but in reality we do not notice it: the ground we walk on seems to be stationary and gives no cause for alarm. The same happens with time. To makes its passing perceptible, novelists have to turn the hands of the clock at dizzying speeds, to make the reader live through 10, 20, 30 years in two minutes.</li>
<li>64/ when we look at the person we love, our inquisitive, anxious, demanding gaze, our expectations of the words which will make us hope for (or despair of) another meeting tomorrow and, until those words are spoken, our obsession fluctuating between possible joy and sorrow, or imagining both of these together, all this distracts our tremulous attention and prevents it from getting a clear picture of the loved one.</li>
<li>190/ regret, like desire, seeks satisfaction and not self-analysis</li>
<li>197-198/ to be no longer in love is to know that forgetting - or even a fading memory- causes much less pain than the unhappiness of loving</li>
<li>206/ unhappiness is a great promoter of morality</li>
<li>223/ habit may weaken all things, but it also stabilises them; it brings about a dislocation, but then makes it last indefinitely</li>
<li>249-250/</li>
<li>292/ on beauty at first sight</li>
<li>343/ life is, alas, so badly arranged that we are rarely enjoy that happiness (from love)</li>
<li>346/ (m. De Charles speaking) it is the height of stupidity to think there is something ridiculous or reprehensible I’m feelings one does not share</li>
<li>368/ on beauty at first sight</li>
<li>442/ on imperfection</li>
<li>448/ when a journey we have longed to make begins to become a reality, and the mind and sensibility are starting to wonder whether it is really worth the effort, the will, which well knows that, if it turned out the journey could not be made, these feckless masters would immediately long for it to become possible again, let’s them loiter in front of the station, having their say, hesitating until the last minute, while it makes sure of buying the tickets and getting us into the train before departure time.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<h3>Volume Three: <i>The Guermantes Way</i></h3>
<li>47/ really fine works of art, if they are given genuine attention, are the ones that disappoint us most, because in the sum total of our ideas there is none that responds to an individual impression</li>
<li>66/ when we are in love, we long to divulge to the woman we love all the secret little privileges we enjoy, as bores and underprivileged people do as a matter of course. It causes us pain that she is unaware of them</li>
<li>70/ (saint-loup to the narrator) what a pity it’s the second rate people like me who are always ready to work, and the ones who could don’t want to!</li>
<li>82/ on sleep and escaping</li>
<li>170/ on unkindness</li>
<li>348/ when the hours are enveloped in conversation we become oblivious to the clock, do not even notice the time, and it slips away until suddenly, way beyond the point at which it escaped our attention, the nimble runaway reappears. But if we are alone, the thing on which our mind is set, by placing before us it’s still distant and ever awaited occurrence with tick-tock regularity, divides, or rather multiplies the hours by all the minutes we would have left uncounted in the company of friends</li>
<li>382/ on pleasure</li>
<li>434 onwards/ describing the Guermantes family</li>
<li>453/ would not a society become secretly more hierarchical as it became ostensibly more democratic? Very possibly. The political power of the popes has increased enormously since they ceased to possess either states or an army</li>
<li>476/ every really original invention stirs the interest even of people who can derive no benefit from it</li>
<li>478/ in love, it often happens that gratitude, the desire to give pleasure, causes us to be generous beyond the limits of what hope and self-interest had envisaged</li>
<li>496/ on Hugo and zola and realism in literature</li>
<li>549-50/ comparing talk with the duchesse to the discoveries we make in the library of a country house</li>
<li>552/ the need to talk prevents one not only from listening, but from noticing anything, and in this case the absence of any description of external surroundings is description enough of an internal state</li>
<li>568/ dinner-parties bore us because our imagination is absent, and reading interests us because it is keeping us company. But the people in question are the same</li>
</ul>
